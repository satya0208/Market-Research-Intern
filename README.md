A biomedical time-series dataset of Zanedo-Saket was given.
It was scalp EEG recording.
Time for 1 EEG segment i.e for 1 column was 23.6 seconds. Total number of columns were 200.
Each column contains 4097 samples.
Sampling frequesncy - 173.6 Hz and Bandwidth - 0.5-40 Hz.
Total patients were 30 : 15 healthy and 15 epileptic.
Data of 10 healthy and 10 epileptic were used.
Implemented a non-linear SVM model for the biomedical time-series dataset. 
Checked the accuracy and validation score for 3 classifiers (SVM, KNN &amp; Naive Baye's).
